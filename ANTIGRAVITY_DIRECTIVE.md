# 🛡️ ANTIGRAVITY OFFICIAL DIRECTIVE: CODE ASSISTANCE PATHWAYS

## **OVERVIEW**
This directive establishes the operational boundaries between **Antigravity Native (Tier 0-1)** and **Gemini Code Assist (Tier 4-5)**. To maintain a "Zero-Lag" AAA environment, developers must choose the correct assistance tier based on the computational and architectural requirements of the task.

---

## **1. USE ANTIGRAVITY NATIVE (TIER 0-1)**
*Use local Python/C++ scripting and manual implementation when:*
*   **Extreme Performance is Required**: Metal 3 shaders, 120Hz physics solvers (Tennis Ball, Collision), and real-time vertex manipulation.
*   **Low-Level System Control**: Inter-process communication (IPC), window management (PySide6), and local file system operations.
*   **Proprietary Engine Logic**: Writing specific C++ Unreal Engine Modules (`AntigravityNativeModule.cpp`) that interact directly with the hardware abstraction layer.
*   **Deterministic Simulation**: When the output must be 100% mathematically consistent without AI "hallucination" (e.g., scoring systems).

---

## **2. USE GEMINI CODE ASSIST (TIER 4-5)**
*Use the Gemini agent and AI-driven automation when:*
*   **Structural Refactoring**: Transitioning the entire project architecture (e.g., consolidating 21 windows into a Unified Master Editor).
*   **Exhaustive Data Generation**: Creating massive boilerplate assets like the full **UE5 Master Menu Structure** or scanning 415+ VS Code extensions for UI categorization.
*   **Complex Algorithmic Discovery**: Deriving procedural math, noise functions, or "Procedural Stream" logic for dynamic environments.
*   **Cross-Domain Integration**: Wiring disparate systems (e.g., connecting a Java Spring metrics feed to a Three.js 3D UMG widget).
*   **Real-Time Problem Solving**: Analyzing Skia/OpenGL/Metal error logs to provide immediate fallback strategies.

---

## **3. THE "HYBRID" COMMAND LOOP**
The ultimate Antigravity state is the **Hybrid Loop**:
1.  **GEMINI** designs the high-level architecture and menu maps.
2.  **NATIVE** executes the time-critical physics and rendering loops.
3.  **GEMINI** monitors the build logs via the **Build Monitor** to suggest optimizations during the UAT packaging process.

---

---

## **4. THE MANDATORY PRE-HANDOVER AUDIT**
**NO HANDOVER** shall occur without a successful execution of the **UI Clicker & Linting Test**.
*   **Tactical Element Scan**: Every button, menu item, and dropdown must be scanned for a valid `onclick`, `href`, or `uiCommand` binding.
*   **Bridge Verification**: Cross-window communication (`CommandBridge`) must be pinged to ensure the Simulator is listening to the Controller.
*   **Visual Linting**: Verify that all `three.min.js` and `qwebchannel.js` assets are resolved and initialized without 404s.
*   **Execution**: The developer must provide a **Test Result Summary** (e.g., "42/42 nodes linked and active") as part of the final response.
