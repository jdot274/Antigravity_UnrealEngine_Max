**Sentient Real-Time Creation in UE. Persistent and evolving node-based multidimensional memory.**

## ⚡ The Primary Power: AI Real-Time Procedural Implementation
This system enables an **AI to procedurally implement code in real-time within the native Unreal Engine 5.7 Editor**. 

- **Viewport Projection**: AI-manifested actors, materials, and physics are efficiently synced and projected directly in the viewport.
- **Architectural Manifestation**: You verbally architect the scene, and the system executes the reality instantly—bridging the gap between natural language intent and environmental state.

---

## 🛡️ Physical Competence
The AI's ability to automate complex engine development through direct manipulation of the project's nervous system.
- **Tactical C++ Injection**: The AI architects C++ source, injects it into the project, and triggers **Live Coding** recompiles.
- **Zero-IDE Workflow**: Remove the need for an external IDE. The AI handles the heavy lifting of C++ implementation and compilation, allowing for a pure "Director" experience.

## 🧠 The Sentient MCP Stack
The underlying architecture that enables real-time execution, transforming a standard development environment into an **"AI-Aware Operating System."**

### Layer 1: The Core (Sentient Reasoner)
- **The Brain**: Powered by **Gemini 1.5-Flash**.
- **Self-Awareness**: The brain is fed live context about project structure, Unreal Engine 5.7 specifications, and asset manifests.

### Layer 2: The Nervous System (MCP Protocol)
- **The Connector**: Built on the **Model Context Protocol**, the universal "glue" between AI logic and machine reality.
- **Knowledge Mesh**: Enables the AI to **Read** local files and **Act** by calling specialized tools to manipulate the engine.

### Layer 3: The Physical Effectors (Real-Time Execution)
- **Engine Execution (`unreal_ai_link.py`)**: Instant procedural code generation and execution (`implement()` / `implement_cpp()`).
- **Visual RAG Galaxy**: A tactical overlay for real-time visualization of the system's "thoughts" and your custom knowledge memory.

## 🚀 Core Technical Accomplishments

### 1. Unified Nexus Hub Architecture
- **Consolidated Interface**: Migrated 21 disparate tool windows into a single, high-fidelity **Unified Master Editor** (`nexus_hub.html`).
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Implemented a premium master-detail layout with an integrated SDF background shader.

### 2. Native Unreal Bridge
- **Direct Engine Integration**: Implemented a native launcher within the Hub that triggers the **UE 5.7 Editor** application.
- **Workflow Sync**: Established a bridge for working in the native Unreal project while maintaining tactical control through the Nexus overlay.

### 3. Multi-Channel NLP AI Integration
- **Gemini-Powered Nexus Bridge**: Support for high-performance Gemini API 1.5-Flash integration via HTTP (Port 3002) and WebSocket (Port 3001).
- **Unreal Editor Terminal Link**: Developed `unreal_ai_link.py`, allowing natural language interaction directly from the **Unreal Engine Python Console**.

### 4. Centralized Nexus Asset Registry
- **Manifest System**: Created `nexus_asset_manifest.json` as the **Single Source of Truth** for all 3D assets.
- **Cross-Format Mapping**: Successfully bridged assets across Spline, Unreal Engine, and glTF/Khronos.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
- `/shader_overlay`: The unified editor and tactical suite (PySide6 + Three.js).
- `/bridge`: The Sentient MCP Stack orchestration layer (Node.js).
- `nexus_asset_manifest.json`: The authoritative version mapping for all engine assets.
- `unreal_ai_link.py`: The live implementation effector.
