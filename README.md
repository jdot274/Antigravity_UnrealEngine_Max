**Antigravity Nexus** is a revolutionary "AI-in-Engine" architecture. It breaks the barrier between the Developer and the Editor by embedding a sentient AI (Antigravity/Gemini) directly into the Unreal Engine 5.7 workspace.

## 🚀 The Zero-Friction Revolution

We have eliminated the "Build" friction. There is no manual setup. There is only **Manifestation**.

### 1. 🧬 The One-Click Twin
A single button in our custom OS-level Master Editor triggers the entire universe:
- **Launches Unreal Engine 5.7** (Backend Process)
- **Auto-Loads** the `AntigravityTwin` Project
- **Manifests** the "Neural Graphics Lab" Level
- **Synchronizes** the Bidirectional AI-Bridge

### 2. 🤖 AI In-Engine
The AI lives *with you* inside the viewport.
- **Native AI Portal**: A custom `Editor Utility Widget` that provides a chat interface to the Agent directly in Unreal.
- **Action Manifestation**: You prompt it, it generates Python code, and **executes it instantly** in the level.
- **Context Aware**: The AI knows what level you are in and what actors you have selected.

### 3. 🔮 Neural Graphics Lab
A dedicated sandbox for next-gen research:
- **Depth-to-Point-Cloud**: Python-driven translation of 2D images into 3D Niagara particle systems.
- **Holographic Simulation**: Real-time rendering of neural data.

## 🛠️ The Architecture

### Layer 0: The Nexus OS (Python/PySide6)
- **Master Editor**: A sleek, glassmorphic desktop hub that controls the entire stack.
- **Universe Monitor**: A persistent "Heads-Up Display" that floats on your screen, tracking the status of every AI subsystem.
- **Visualizer**: A d3.js-based "Knowledge Graph" of your project's architecture.

### Layer 1: The Bridge (`ai_engine_bridge.py`)
- A high-speed, bidirectional communication layer that syncs state between the OS Layer and the Game Engine.
- **Latency**: < 50ms.
- **Protocol**: JSON Command Queue.

### Layer 2: The Twin Engine (Unreal C++)
- **Battery-Included**: Pre-configured with all critical research plugins (Niagara, ML Deformer, Python API, Web Browser).
- **Native Widgets**: Custom UMG/Blueprint tools that mirror the OS-level HUDs.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Launch the Nexus
```bash
python3 shader_overlay/master_launch.py
```

### 2. Click "SYNC UNREAL TWIN"
Watch as the system:
1.  Spools up the Unreal Editor process.
2.  Auto-runs `init_unreal_twin.py`.
3.  Opens the **AI Agent Portal** in your face.

### 3. Build with words.
Type inside the portal: *"Spawn a 10x10 grid of emissive spheres."* -> **Manifest.**
